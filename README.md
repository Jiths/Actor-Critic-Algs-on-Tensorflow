# A3C-vs-A2C-on-tensorflow

The goal of this project is to provide high quality implementations of two popular distributed Reinforcement Learning methods, A3C (Asynchronous Actor Critic) and A2C (Synchronous Actor Critic), and compare their performance in a few OpenAI gym environments. 

Package requirements: gym, Python3, Tensorflow 1.3

The project is currently in the development mode.
