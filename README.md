# A3C-vs-A2C-on-tensorflow

The goal of this project is to provide high quality implementations of a few of popular distributed Reinforcement Learning methods. In the first phase, we focus on the basic Actor-Critic and its asynchronous version A3C. We later plan to implement and compare these with A2C (Synchronous Actor Critic) in terms of time and sample complexities in a few OpenAI gym environments. 

## requirements: 
OpenAI gym, Python3, Tensorflow 1.3.

We recommend using a package manager such as conda for convenience.
